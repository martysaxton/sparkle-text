## GitHub Pages deployment: Vite app + Storybook

- Vite app is built to `dist/` with a base of `/<repo>/` via the workflow step: `bun run build -- --base=/${{ github.event.repository.name }}/`.
- Storybook uses a relative base set in `.storybook/main.ts` (`viteFinal` sets `config.base = './'`) so it can be served from a subpath.
- CI builds Storybook with `bun run build-storybook` (output `storybook-static/`) and copies it into `dist/storybook/` before uploading the Pages artifact.
- Resulting URLs on GitHub Pages:
  - App: `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`
  - Storybook: `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/storybook/`
- If using a custom domain or changing repository name, ensure the Vite `--base` in the workflow and Storybook base/path still resolve correctly.

### SparkleText overlay positioning in Storybook

- This project does not include Tailwind CSS in Storybook. Utility class names like `relative`, `absolute`, and `inset-0` are not translated into CSS there.
- `SparkleText` originally relied on those class names, which caused the canvas to be laid out as a normal inline element next to the text in Storybook, shifting sparkles to the right.
- Fix: use inline styles for layout-critical rules (`position: relative` on the wrapper, `position: absolute` with top/left/right/bottom 0 on the canvas). This guarantees correct overlay independent of external CSS frameworks.

### Storybook 9 addon change: backgrounds

- In Storybook 9, `@storybook/addon-backgrounds` package no longer exists and should not be listed in `addons`.
- Background switching works via `parameters.backgrounds` in `.storybook/preview.ts` without adding any addon.
